Description: Creates discretised versions of continuous 
      distribution functions by mapping continuous values 
      to an underlying discrete grid, based on a (uniform) 
      frequency of discretisation, a valid discretisation 
      point, and an integration range. For a review of 
      discretisation methods, see 
      Chakraborty (2015) <doi:10.1186/s40488-015-0028-6>.
